## About This Project

This repository documents my first week of hands-on Rust programming.  
The main focus is on learning and practicing core Rust concepts: ownership, borrowing, references, and basic project setup.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Master core Rust concepts: **ownership, borrowing, slices, structs**
- Minimum **2 commits every day** to ensure steady progress

## Ownership

Explore Rust’s ownership system for safe memory management.  
_See corresponding code examples and explanations in the `/src/ownership.rs` file._

## Borrowing

Understand references and borrowing to enable function arguments without taking ownership.  
_Check `/src/borrowing.rs` for practical demos!_

## Slices

Learn slicing for referencing parts of collections like arrays or strings efficiently.  
_Example code in `/src/slices.rs`._

## Structs

Build and use custom data types in Rust.  
_See `/src/structs.rs` for exercises and explanations._

## 🛠 How to Run

1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ka-369/rust-learning-journey-week1.git
   cd rust-learning-journey-week1
   ```
2. **Compile and run** the sample files:
   - With plain Rust:  
     `rustc filename.rs && ./filename`
   - (Recommended) With Cargo (if/when the repo is converted into a Cargo project):  
     `cargo run`
